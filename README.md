DOMAIN: PYTHON PROGRAMMING

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

PLATFORM USED: VS CODE

INTRODUCTION
DESCRITION:I developed a system that collects data, processes it, and generates reports automatically—without manual effort. The goal was to save time and ensure consistent reporting by turning raw data into readable summaries, tables, and charts.

TOOLS & TECHNIQUES USED:

Python – Core scripting language
Pandas – Data cleaning and manipulation
Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization
FPDF / XlsxWriter – Report export (PDF/Excel)
Jinja2 – HTML template-based reporting
Git & GitHub – Version control and project sharing
VS Code – Main coding editor

EDITOR PLATFORM USED:

All development work was done using Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It provided an efficient coding environment with features such as syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, live server previews, and Git integration. This helped streamline my workflow and made debugging and testing more efficient. I also used Postman to test and validate API responses before integrating them into my application.

APPLICATION OF THIS PROJECT:

This project can be applied in finance, sales, education, HR, healthcare, or any industry where data needs to be regularly reported. Automated reports save time, reduce errors, and support better decision-making.


OUTPUT :

The final reports include images of line charts, bar charts, and pie charts
All charts are auto-generated and saved as picture files
